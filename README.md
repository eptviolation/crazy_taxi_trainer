# Crazy Taxi Trainer
This is a simple trainer for Crazy Taxi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Taxi_(video_game))
Open with Visual Studio and compile the project with x86 (32 Bit) configuration.
This is required as the game is a 32 Bit application, therefore the trainer needs the same bitness to be able to
open and write into the game process.

The Trainer was tested on Windows 10 20H2 (19042.1706) with the Steam version of Crazy Taxi (Build ID 403161).
In case of an update, the offset might shift and would require an adjustment.
The whole project was done just for fun :D
